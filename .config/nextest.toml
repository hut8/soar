# Nextest configuration for SOAR project
#
# Tests use isolated per-test databases created from the soar_test_template
# template database, enabling full parallel execution without interference.
#
# Each test gets its own isolated database via the TestDatabase helper
# (see tests/common/mod.rs), which is automatically created and cleaned up.

[profile.default]
# Full parallel execution enabled
# No thread limit needed - tests use isolated databases
