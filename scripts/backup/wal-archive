# wal-archive - Archive PostgreSQL WAL segments to cloud storage
#
# This script is called by PostgreSQL via archive_command for each completed
# WAL segment (typically 16MB files). It uploads the WAL file to cloud storage
# using rclone and verifies the upload succeeded.
#
# Usage (called by PostgreSQL):
#   wal-archive <wal_path> <wal_filename>
#
# Arguments:
#   $1 - Full path to WAL file in pg_wal/ directory
#   $2 - WAL filename only (e.g., 000000010000000000000001)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - Success (WAL file archived)
#   1 - Failure (PostgreSQL will retry)
#
# Configuration:
#   Source credentials from /etc/soar/backup-env
#   Rclone config at /etc/soar/rclone.conf
#
# Example archive_command in postgresql.conf:
#   archive_command = '/usr/local/bin/soar-wal-archive %p %f'
