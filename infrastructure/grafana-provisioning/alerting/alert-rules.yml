# Grafana Alerting Rules Configuration
# This defines the alert conditions and thresholds for SOAR monitoring
#
# IMPORTANT: These alerts filter by environment label to ensure staging and production
# alerts are independent. This allows both environments to run on the same server
# without cross-environment false alerts.
#
# noDataState is set to OK so alerts don't fire when the environment isn't running
# on this server (e.g., staging alerts won't fire on production-only servers).
