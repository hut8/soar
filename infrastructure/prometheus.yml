# Prometheus configuration for SOAR metrics scraping
#
# This file uses scrape_config_files to load complete scrape job configurations.
# This allows you to manage SOAR service scrape jobs in separate files.
#
# To use this configuration:
# 1. Copy infrastructure/prometheus-jobs/*.yml to /etc/prometheus/jobs/
# 2. That's it! Prometheus will automatically load all .yml files from that directory

global:
  scrape_interval: 15s      # Default scrape interval (can be overridden per job)
  evaluation_interval: 15s  # Evaluate rules every 15 seconds

  # Attach these labels to all metrics scraped by this Prometheus instance
  external_labels:
    environment: 'production'
    service: 'soar'

# Load all scrape job configurations from separate files
scrape_config_files:
  - '/etc/prometheus/jobs/*.yml'

# Alerting configuration (optional)
# alerting:
#   alertmanagers:
#     - static_configs:
#         - targets:
#             - 'localhost:9093'

# Rule files for alerting (optional)
# rule_files:
#   - 'rules/*.yml'
