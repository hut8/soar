# SOAR Aggregation Timer (Staging)
#
# This systemd timer automatically runs the `soar-staging run-aggregates` command once daily at 2:00 AM.
# It processes the previous day's position fixes into H3 hexagonal coverage zones and
# aggregates flight analytics (daily/hourly stats, duration buckets, aircraft/club/airport analytics).
#
