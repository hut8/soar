# SOAR Pull Data Timer (Staging)
#
# This systemd timer automatically runs the `soar pull-data` command once daily at 3:00 AM
# for the staging environment.
# It downloads the latest airports, runways, and aircraft data from official sources,
# and optionally pulls devices, geocodes locations, and links home bases.
#
