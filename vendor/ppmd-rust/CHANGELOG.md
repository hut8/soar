## 1.2.1 - 2025-07-05

### Added

- Add an `unstable-tagged-offsets` unstable feature used to validate the proper function of the implementation. It is
  not activated as a general safety feature, since it would reduce the maximal allowed memory size and in such break
  compatibility with existing data.

## 1.2.0 - 2025-07-03

### Added

- Auto traits Send and Sync are implemented for the decoder and encoder.

## 1.1.2 - 2025-07-03

### Fixed

- No functional changes
- Fixed links in cargo to fix broken link in crates.io

## 1.1.1 - 2025-07-03

### Fixed

- Fixed errors in the ported code that created different PPMd code for both PPMd7 and PPMd7:
  (https://github.com/hasenbanck/ppmd-rust/issues/3)

### Added

- Added bigger test corpus to verify implementation.

## 1.1.0 - 2025-06-28

### Added

- Added a `finish()` method on the encoders, so that finishing the encoding process is more straightforward.
- Allow the encoding of an end marker into the compressed data to properly
  support cases, where the uncompressed data size if not known at decompression time.

## 1.0.0 - 2025-06-27

### Updated

- Ported the C code for PPMd8 to Rust (as used in the ZIP archive format).
- Lowered MSRV to 1.82

## 0.3.0 - 2025-06-22

### Updated

- Ported the C code for PPMd7 to Rust (as used in the 7z archive format).

## 0.2.0 - 2025-02-28

### Added

- Provided a safe Rust abstraction over the 7zip PPMd C library
