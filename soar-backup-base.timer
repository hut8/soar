# SOAR Backup Base Timer
#
# This systemd timer automatically runs full database backups once weekly on Sunday at 2:00 AM.
# It creates a complete physical backup using pg_basebackup, compresses it, and uploads to
# cloud storage (S3-compatible).
#
# Backup details:
#   - Frequency: Weekly (Sunday 2:00 AM)
#   - Method: pg_basebackup (physical backup)
#   - Compression: gzip
#   - Storage: Cloud storage (S3/B2/etc.)
#   - Retention: 30 days (4 weekly backups)
#   - Duration: ~2-4 hours for 420GB database
#
# Combined with continuous WAL archiving, this provides point-in-time recovery capability
# for any moment within the 30-day retention period.
#
# Installation:
